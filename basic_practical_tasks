Click the "Create" button and wait while SharePoint creates your website.

Step 2: Adding a New Document Library
After creating a website, open it in a browser.
In the left navigation bar, select "Site Content" or "Site Resources".

Enter a name for the document library and click New.

Step 3: Upload Documents to the Library

Right click on the document and select "Edit Properties" or "Properties".
Make any necessary changes to the document's metadata or properties and click Save or Apply.

Step 5: Document Version Control
In the document library, select the document for which you want to enable version control.
Right click on the document and select "Versions" or "Version History".
In this section, you can view and manage different versions of the document, add comments, and restore previous versions if necessary.

Step 6: Create a task list
On a SharePoint site, open a team site, or select the Create List option from the Site Content or Site Resources menu.
Select "Task List" from the available list templates.
Give a name to the task list and click "Create".

Step 7: Adding Tasks to the Task List
Open the newly created task list.
Click on the "Add New Item" or "New Task" button.
Fill in the required fields, such as task name, priority, due date, and responsible person.
Click "Save" or "Apply" to add the task to the list.

Step 8: Manage Tasks in the Task List
In the task list, select the task you want to edit or update.
Click on a task to open it for editing.
Make the necessary changes, for example, change the status of the task or assign a different responsible person.
Click "Save" or "Apply" to apply the changes to the task.

Step 9: Adding Web Parts to the Team Site
Open a team site in SharePoint.
Click on "Edit" or "Page Setup" to edit the site.
Click in an empty area on the page where you want to add the web part.
Click the "Add Web Part" or "Add New Item" button and select the desired Web Part from the list of available options.
Configure web part settings, such as selecting a data source for calendar or tasks.

Step 10: Creating the Wiki Pages
Open the SharePoint website where you want to create a wiki page.
Click on "Site Content" or "Site Resources" in the left navigation bar.
Select "Wiki Pages" or "Create Page" from the available options.
Enter a name for the wiki page and click "Create".
Edit the content of a wiki page using the text formatting, graphics, and inline links features available in the SharePoint editor.

Step 11: Gather Usage Statistics and Create a Report
Open the SharePoint website for which you want to collect usage statistics.
Go to site settings or site administration.
Look for a section related to analytics or usage statistics (for example, "Usage statistics" or "Visit analytics").
Turn on the collection of usage statistics and select the parameters that you want to track (for example, visits, document views, changes, and other activities).
Wait for SharePoint to start collecting user activity data.

Step 12: Create a SharePoint Usage Report
Go to the analytics or usage statistics section of the SharePoint website.
Set up filters and options for the report to get the data you want (for example, select a time period, users, or activity types).
Click the Generate Report or Get Data button.
Wait for the report to complete.
View the report, which can include graphs, tables, or other data visualizations of user activity and SharePoint usage.


Each step may have some variations depending on the specific version of SharePoint and your site settings. 
We recommend that you review the SharePoint documentation and user guide for more details and instructions specific to your SharePoint environment.
